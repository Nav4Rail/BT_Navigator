<!--
  This Behavior Tree wraps the standard Nav2 "navigate to pose with replanning + recovery"
  behavior inside a subtree, then performs a spin.

  Notes:
  - The navigation subtree shares the same blackboard (goal/path/etc) via __shared_blackboard.
  - The whole sequence is wrapped in KeepRunningUntilFailure to loop continuously.

<!--
  This Behavior Tree replans the global path periodically at 1 Hz and it also has
  recovery actions specific to planning / control as well as general system issues.
  This will be continuous if a kinematically valid planner is selected.
